                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I would like to share with you some of 
                    my favorite things to eat.This menu was 
                    created because I have a passion for cooking 
                    and I especially love to eat breakfast. 
                    These dishes are a collection of my 
                    best recipes that I often make for family 
                    and friends.I am proud of the fact that we 
                    serve fresh, wholesome food that is 
                    thoughtfully prepared and attractively 
                    presented. The secret ingredient in 
                    everything is love! I hope you enjoy your 
                    meal. Thank you for visiting! : ) Love, Kaila</p>

                    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>After its nondescript opening in 2007, Café Kaila 
                        quickly became one of the most talked about 
                        breakfast cafes in the area. Word spread quickly, 
                        and within months of opening, there were lines 
                        outside the door. Since then, Café Kaila has gone 
                        from strength to strength, and in 2012 opened its 
                        second store in Tokyo, Japan. We stay true to our 
                        original philosophy though, and never forget those 
                        who helped us to get where we are now.</p>

                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>It always has been, and always will be the case 
                        that customers come first at Café Kaila. The 
                        quality of food (inside, outside, and of course 
                        taste), and all-round dining experience are 
                        fundamental to everyone at Café Kaila. Even 
                        at the busiest times, we do our best to make 
                        everyone’s experience as pleasant as possible, be 
                        they a local or a tourist, waiting to come in or 
                        paying the check.</p>
